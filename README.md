# nQueen-solver
Finds the number of solutions to the n Queen problem.
See: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/n-queen-problem-backtracking-3/

This program was made in **Node.js v14.15.5**.

# How to use
1. Modify the line `const n = 9;` to whichever value of n you would like to analyse.
2. Run the program with `node index.js`.
3. The console will output the number of solutions to the n Queen problem.

# Possible improvements
Instead of outputting the number of solutions, output the number of unique solutions as well. (Mirror images and rotations will not count as unique.)
